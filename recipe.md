2 medium aubergines
70 g Tahini – 2-3 tbsp
juice of 2 lemons
1 Garlic clove
1 tbsp Olive oil
1 tsp salt
Pinch ground pepper
¼ tsp Sumac or chilli powder- optional

Preheat the oven to 220 C fan, cut eggplant in half lengthways, rub a little oil on the inside of the aubergine and place on a baking tray flesh side down, sprinkle with salt and cook for 40 mins until the aubergine is charred and collapsed and is super soft. Or if you have a gas stove you can cook the aubergine directly on an open flame, turning occasionally, for approx 15 minutes or until charred and collapsed and super soft inside. Allow to cool for a few minutes until you can handle them, into a medium mixing bowl, scrape out the soft flesh from the aubergine ( it should come away easily from the skin. Add the remaining ingredients and mix well. Taste and season with lemon, salt or heat to your preference. Serve in a bowl with a splash of olive oil and sprinkle on some sumac or chilli powder and enjoy!
